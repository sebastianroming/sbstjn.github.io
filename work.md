I love to build projects around motivated people while providing my team members with the environment they need to grow, evolve, and to achieve the best possible results. Being a Team Lead, my success is bound to the success of my team and all its members. I enjoy providing guidance and support in the process of planning and decision making as much as being knee-deep in code. To ensure my team’s priorities are reflected within the product roadmap, I enjoy working closely with other managers to plan the next steps for my team, the product, and the company.

Besides managing engineers and being hands-on whenever needed, I deeply care about design, accessibility, and information. I love to spread ideas, create open source projects, and help people to get started with new technologies, tools, and ideas.

I prefer to use PMAs, resilient testing, and prioritization by the cost of delay when needed. I build hard- and software prototypes, design concepts, create storyboards and wireframes. I deliver project architectures from the whiteboard to production and help to introduce and maintain broadly used industry standards.

Kaizen and ongoing, regular, and informal feedback are important core values I believe in: No matter how good I already may be, I can always get better and I do believe in the power of small improvements to achieve a larger goal.
