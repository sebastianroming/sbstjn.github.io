I love to build projects around motivated people while providing my team with the environment they need to grow, evolve, and for achieving the best results. Being a Team Lead my success is bound to the success of my team and all its members. I enjoy providing technical guidance and support in the process of planning and decision making. To ensure my team’s priorities are reflected within the product roadmap I like to work closely with product managers to plan the next steps for my team, the product, and the company.

Kaizen and ongoing, regular, and informal feedback are important core values I believe in: No
matter how good I already am, I can always get better and I do believe in the power of small
improvements.
