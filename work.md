I love to build projects around motivated people while providing my team members with the environment they need to grow, evolve, and for achieving the best possible results. Being a Team Lead my success is bound to the success of my team and all its members. I enjoy providing technical guidance and support in the process of planning and decision making. To ensure my team’s priorities are reflected within the product roadmap, I enjoy working closely with managers to plan the next steps for my team, the product, and the company.

Besides managing engineers and being hands-on whenever needed, I deeply care about design, accessibility, and information. I love to spread ideas, write open source software, and help people to start with new technologies and tools.

I prefer to use PMAs, resilient testing, and prioritization by the cost of delay when needed. I built hard- and software prototypes, designed concepts, storyboards, and wireframes. I delivered project architectures from the whiteboard to production and helped to introduce and maintain broadly used industry standards.

Kaizen and ongoing, regular, and informal feedback are important core values I believe in: No
matter how good I already am, I can always get better and I do believe in the power of small
improvements to achieve a larger goal.
