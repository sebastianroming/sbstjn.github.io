    Together with my team I make sure Jimdoâ€™s website builder and more than 15 million websites
    from our customers work like a charm. We take care of the ongoing maintenance and development of core components as well as
    building new features to ensure the product creates value for our customers. Being the
    first contact person for all non-developers I also emphasise building internal tools that
    empower everyone within the company to support our customer in the best possible way.

    Working in an agency may sound boring and stressful for product developers or managers. It
    definitely is stressful, but as a Senior Developer at E7 I was delighted to work for
    countless clients, all of them best of their branches. Thanks to Elephant Seven I was able to
    achieve a <em>Red Dot Award for Game design</em> and compete to win a Cannes Lion for an iOS
    application.

    Being the first engineer of a startup comes with a lot of freedom and requires a large
    amount of responsibility. Whenever you can start to design and code on a whiteboard dreams
    come true. I learnt a lot about communication, managing teams, supporting engineers and
    how to establish processes while helping the company to grow and to become a leading provider
    of software solutions for the telecommunications industry.
