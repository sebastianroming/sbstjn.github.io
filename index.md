Team Lead and Software Engineer living and working in Hamburg, Germany. Daytime [Engineering Team Lead at **Jimdo**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbstjn) and passionate about software, design, people and vegan food.

After 17 years of creating websites, I still enjoy most parts of developing and designing applications for the web. You can find all public projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/sbstjn), for example, [Timesheet.js](https://github.com/sbstjn/timesheet.js) with more than six thousand Stargazers. The most interesting recent projects are [hanu](https://github.com/sbstjn/hanu) for writing Slack bots or the [CLI Notes](https://clinot.es) example project to manage text notes from the command line. Lately, I published a few [plugins for serverless](https://github.com/sbstjn?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=serverless&type=&language=), you will find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/sbstjn?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=serverless&type=&language=).

Before leading, managing, and mentoring engineers at [Jimdo](http://jimdo.com), I was delighted to work as a **Senior Engineer** for [Elephant Seven](https://www.publicispixelpark.de/) in Hamburg, **Creative Technologist** at the [Intuity Media Lab](http://intuity.de) in Hamburg and Stuttgart, and **Lead Engineer and Scrum Master** for [Roamsys](http://roamsys.com) in Trier.

My passion for sharing thoughts and spreading knowledge has been strengthened with building up **MACNOTES** back in 2006 until we sold the project some years later&nbsp;…
