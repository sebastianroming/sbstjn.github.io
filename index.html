  After 16 years of creating websites I still enjoy most parts of
  developing and designing for the web. You can find all public available
  projects on <a href="https://github.com/sbstjn" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, for
  example <a href="https://github.com/sbstjn/timesheet.js" target="_blank">Timesheet.js</a>
  with nearly six thousand stars. The most interesting recent projects are
  <a href="https://github.com/sbstjn/hanu">hanu</a> for writing Slack bots or
  <a href="https://clinot.es">CLI Notes</a> to manage text notes from the command line.

<p>
  Before working at <a href="http://jimdo.com" target="_blank">Jimdo</a>, I was delighted to work as a <strong>Senior Developer</strong>
  for <a href="http://elephant-seven.com" target="_blank">Elephant Seven</a> in Hamburg, <strong>Creative Technologist</strong>
  at the <a href="http://intuity.de" target="_blank">Intuity Media Lab</a> in Hamburg and Stuttgart, and
  as <strong>Lead Developer and Scrum Master</strong> for <a href="http://roamsys.com" target="_blank">Roamsys</a> in Trier.
</p>
<p>
  My passion for sharing thoughts and spreading knowledge has been
  strengthened with building up <strong>MACNOTES</strong> back in
  2006 until we sold the project some years later&nbsp;…
