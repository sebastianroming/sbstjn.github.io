<div id="personality">
  <p>
    I love to build projects around motivated individuals while providing my team with the environment
    they need to grow, evolve, and for getting the best possible results. Being a Team Lead my
    success is measured by the success of my team and all its members. I enjoy providing technical guidance
    and support in the process of planning and decision making. To ensure my team’s priorities are reflected
    within the product roadmap I work closely with product managers to plan the next steps for my
    team, the product, and the company.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kaizen and ongoing, regular, and informal feedback are important core values I believe in: No
    matter how good I already am, I can always get better and I do believe in the power of small
    improvements.
